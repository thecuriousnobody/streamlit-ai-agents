CURRENT PERSPECTIVES

1. Emerging Research Directions:
- Oral history documentation of Muslim women's partition experiences
- Intersectional analysis of minority women's political participation
- Source: "A Report on Making Women Count for Peace" recommends focused studies on women's local governance roles

2. Contemporary Scholarly Perspectives:
- Recognition of women as critical peace-building agents
- Emphasis on understanding "minority within minority" experiences
- Source: "Human Rights and Peace Audit Exercises" highlights the complexity of minority identity negotiations

Research Limitations:
- Sparse direct documentation of Muslim women peace activists in 1947-1960 Assam
- Need for more comprehensive oral history collection
- Recommended next steps include targeted archival research and community engagement

Recommended Research Strategies:
1. Conduct oral history interviews with surviving partition-era women
2. Explore regional archives in Assam
3. Connect with local women's organizations
4. Investigate archival materials from 1947-1960 period

This comprehensive analysis reveals the nuanced, complex experiences of Muslim women peace activists in post-partition Assam, highlighting their critical role in navigating challenging political and social landscapes.
